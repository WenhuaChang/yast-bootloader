        <para>

        <title>Proposing configuration</title>
        <para>
Initial proposing generates standard sections and implicit globals. Each section has additional internal attribute describing it's state (was proposed and not changed by user) and
devices it uses (usually the device containing /boot and / (root) partitions, in case of loading bootsector of other partition the device of the partition).
When checking the proposal, partitions of each sections get compared to partitions, which have been changed, and depending on the result section is recreated, left as is, or
user gets warned.
	</para>
	<para>
Because when proposing configuration it does't have to be clear whether initrd will exist, memtest86 will be present or graphic menu available, there is additional checking done
when writing configuration. If in configuration file mentioned file doesn't exist (eg. initrd not created), corresponding record is removed from configuration file before writing
ut to the disk.
