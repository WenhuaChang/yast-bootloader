<B>lilo.conf os examples
=====================</B>

<B>single Linux on machine, no '/boot' partition
=============================================</b>
fdisk says there is one <b>swap</b> partition, one <b>Linux</b> partition
this is the most trivial case. just look at the /boot directory for
kernel images.

<B>single Linux: one swap, two Linux partitions
============================================</b>
fdisk found one or two <b>swaps</b> and two <b>Linux </b>or more partitions.
try to figure out, which partition is root and look at it's <b>/etc/fstab
</b>file. if there's a 'boot' partition, mount it. the rest is the same as 
in previous case.

<B>multiple Linuxes
================</B>

see <A href=strategy.html>strategy.html</A>

<B>Dos,Win 95/98
=============</b>
there is a <b>Fat32, Fat16</b> partition called '/dev/hda1'. other Fat16/32
partitions are (probably) non-bootable win/dos partitions.

<b>WinNT
=====</b>
This is a bit tricky. Each<b> NTFS </b>partition<b> </b>is potentially
bootable. Lilo <b>must not</b> be installed to MBR, because on MBR resides
the NT-bootloader. Lilo should be installed to linux root partition.

    a) The easiest way is to install lilo to floppy.
    b) Otherwise these changes must be made to NT bootloader:
        1) lilo will be installed to linux root partition.
        2) the bootsector from linux root partition will
           be copied to partition readable by NT. see link below
        3) the line 'C:\BOOTSECT.LNX="Linux"'; must
           be added to C:\boot.ini.
