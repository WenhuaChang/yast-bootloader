		   A guide for discovering linux distribution
				  and version

<B>1. Intro</B>
   Let's suggest that we have a partition with already installed linux.
   Let's also assume, that /etc directory is not mounted from another
   partition (if it was so, this partition would hardly be root filesystem, 
   because /etc/fstab would be inaccessible).

<B>2. Distributions</B>

<B>2.1 SuSE linux</B>

   A file /etc/SuSE-release is present. It contains two lines. 
   It contains string "SuSE Linux $VER ($ARCH)\nVERSION = $VER"
   where VER is version number (eg. 7.1) and ARCh is architecture.

<B>2.2 Debian linux</B>

   A file /etc/debian-version is present. it contains a version number

<B>2.3 Turbolinux </B>

   A file /etc/turbolinux-release is present. contains a version number

<B>2.4 Mandrake linux</B>

   A file /etc/mandrake-release is present. contains a version number
