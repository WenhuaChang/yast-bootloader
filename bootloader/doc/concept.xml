    <title>Bootloader module concept</title>

    <section>
	<title>Encapsulation</title>
	<para>
Every other module, which needs to access bootloader, shouldn't need to know that there are many different boot loaders. Because of this there is the
<computeroutput>Bootloader</computeroutput> module, which encapsulates functions of other boot loaders, and calls appropriate function of appropriate 
module depending on currently used bootloader. This interface should stay stable as long as possible, the probability that some internal interfaces will 
change in future, is much higher.
	</para>
    </section>

    <section>
	<title>One-way import</title>
	<para>
Since cyclic importing of modules may bring a lot of problems because of cyclic calling inside constructors, in the whole bootloader module all importing is done
only one way. The only exception is interaction with Storage module forced by needs to regard the disk situation when deciding what bootloader to use on one side,
and the need to know what bootloader is used when proposing partitioning on the other side. There is no import cycle inside whole bootloader module, the bootloader
module's modules are strictly layered, each module imports only modules from bellow layers.
	</para>
	<para>
On the other hand, because calling of functions between modules in both directions can be needed sometimes, calling of two functions from two different modules each other is possible
if we can be sure that called module has already been loaded.
	</para>

    <section>
	<title>Files included only once</title>
	<para>
Since included file is parsed on every place where it is included (often many times during one run of YaST2), it takes some time. Because of this include files
from bootloader-related modules are included into just one module/client file. This brings the advantage of performance, and helps avoiding import-include cycles.
Since the file is imported by one module only, it isn't needed to import this module nor use it's identifier when accessing it's variables and/or functions.
Here are two exceptions: One is the pop-ups.ycp include file, which doesn't need any functions of any module from bootloader package, and the other one is ui.ycp,
which is included by several clients.
	</para>
    </section>

    <section>
	<title>Bootloader dependent/independent parts border</title>
	<para>
Since there are many different boot loaders supported (currently should be supported at least LILO, GRUB, ELILO, S390 bootloader and PPC bootloader), there was really needed
to define clearly the border between code, which is bootloader dependent and code which is bootloader independent.
	</para>
	<para>
There are three main layers. The top one is made by the Bootloader module and it's includes, partially the ui.ycp include. This is the point clients and other
modules should use to use bootloader functions. This layer is bootloader independent, but there are some locations regarding different boot loaders. There are bootloader
switching (configuration conversion) mechanisms, bootloader-dependent function choosing mechanism, maybe some others.
	</para>
	<para>
Second, middle layer, is made of bootloader-dependent modules, and their includes. Every supported bootloader should have it's module. It should be the only point,
where common part of bootloader module accesses the bootloader-dependent parts. This module must contain function describing what function specific to this bootloader
are present. Should contain all bootloader-specific routines.
	</para>
	<para>
The last, bottom layer, contains routines, which may be used by more boot loaders, and generic versions of bootloader-specific functions, which get called if no specific function
for currently used bootloader is present. Also contains many variables for storing general information and for some by more bootloader used variables.
	</para>
    </section>

    <section>
	<title>Bootloader attributes</title>
	<para>
As many functions for different boot loaders are very similar, but still differ, it would make developers duplicate a lot of code. Because of it many functions use some parameters
describing bootloader which we are configuring now. These parameters are eg. key of section title in cfg. file, packages required for running the bootloader, and others.
Functions aren't parameterized by the bootloader, but by these parameters, which results in less "iffing", and adding support for other bootloader means to set these parameters,
and not update the whole code.
	</para>
    </section>

    <section>
	<title>Installation vs. configuration of installed system</title>
	<para>
There is only one module for both of these tasks. Only one UI, only one internals. There are proposing functions available during configuration of installed system,
this way it is possible to recreate original configuration.
	</para>
    </section>
    <section>
	<title>Installation</title>
	<para>
There is full control of the installation process - not only location and few additional parameters, but everything,
including bootloader sections and manual editing of future configuration files.
This brought some problems (because after user creates/modifies sections, many things including disk partitioning may change), but they seem to be
solved and configuration (automatically set settings) are updated every time disk configuration changes. Sections created/modified by user of course can't be changed.

	<title>UI</title>
	<para>
The concept of UI is described in separate chapter.
